<h2>Treasure Hunt</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Dig through the depth of the earth to reach the treasure below and get rich.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players can casually push around the various items to reach the treasure.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a casual adventure minigame.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player is able to move in all directions. When comming in contact with a non-treasure item they can push it away. If the player comes in contact with a treasure, then the treasure is collected. A counter in the corner shows how many treasure objects the player has collected and how many are left. There may also be traps hidden underground that may stun or injure the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game mechanics shown are the ability to push objects around as well as collecting certain objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There are alot of other objects underground along with the treasure. Some of the treasure may be hidden behind some of the clutter.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
No one knows what sleeps underground, but the great treasure hunter Neil travels around the world searching the Earth for hidden treasures.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
With tremendous courage, Neil fears nothing and will stop at nothing to uncover rare treasures.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience of this game are casual gamers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Gameplay is around 1~2 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategically manuevering around obsticles will allow players to reach the treasure faster.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
It may take a few weeks or even longer to complete this game. A counter, health system, traps, and extended map still need to be implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
I was able to look at various examples and put a prototype together. I enjoyed changing the art and even creating some of it. I do know a little javascript but it was frustrating to figure out how to add mechanics I wanted for the game. In addition in a lack of skills in javascript, it was also somewhat difficult to think of ideas that would be easy to implement into the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used assets from the 'Making your first Phaser game' tutorial and art from RPGMaker.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used the Sprite Vs Group Example from phaser.
